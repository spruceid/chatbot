# Chatbot 

Chatbot is a [SpruceKit](https://sprucekit.dev) example that leverages Sign-In with Ethereum and user-controlled data via Kepler via [SSX](https://sprucekit.dev/ssx/ssx-overview).

It leverages ChatbotUI an open-source UI, and SSX for authentication, data saving, and data sharing functionality.

## Running Locally

### Providing an OpenAI API Key

When using the interface for the first time and signing in, you will be prompted to enter an OpenAI API key after creating your data vault. Note - the application will not work without an OpenAI API key.

Once signed in, you can start chatting.
